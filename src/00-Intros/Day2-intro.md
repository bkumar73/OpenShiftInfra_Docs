Day 2 components, for the purposes of this guide, are defined as any component that is required to be in place before the cluster can handle workload.

In this case Day 2 components enable customization of the cluster, allow traffic to flow to applications, providing a variety of storage classes for applications to consume as well as tools to backup workloads and their data.
